# Portfolio Projects

### 1. [New York Taxi: The 67GB Data Analysis](https://github.com/imdwipayana/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/67%20GB%20Full%20Data%20Analysis)
Data analysis with big data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/microize/nyc-taxi-dataset). With RAM 16GB, it needs strategy to analyze the data properly such as using the appropriate method and tools since all data can not be put at once into memory. This project is the practice for strategical data analysis with pipeline and data streaming strategy. Tools that use are Polars, DuckDB and PySpark and Pytorch. Problems that will be solved are classification, clustering and time series data analysis. Those will combine Pyhton and SQL skills with Tableau and Power BI as data visualization tools.

### 2. [AI Chatbot using Transformer](https://github.com/imdwipayana/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/AI%20Chatbot%20using%20LLM/AIChatbot%20with%20Transformer.ipynb)
Basic AI chatbot from various language models are created and tested on their language understanding. This basic project is really good for beginner understanding and application of Large Language Model Languange(LLM), but more advance language model is required for fully understanding of communication in the chat.

### 3. [SQL for PostgreSQL](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL) 
Documentations of SQL queries run in PostgreSQL. In this project the common queries useq in SQL are provided. Each topics consists of simple table for easier practicing and all codes are ready to go. The project can be seen in [here](https://github.com/imdwipayana/PostgreSQL).

### 4. [SQL for DB Browser SQLite](https://github.com/imdwipayana/DB-Browser-for-SQLite)
