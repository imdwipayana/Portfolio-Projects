    "# New York Taxi Tipping Prediction: Yellow Taxi and Green Taxi Classification\n",
    "After data manipulation, the tabular data is ready to go to the next step, which is the classification. There are two challenges here which are the data size and the imballance dataset. Solution for the first challenge is by using batching. In batching, the calculation will be done every batch size. In here we will use 100000 rows of data for each batch. Meanwhile for the second challenge, we will use tree based model that friendly with imbalance dataset. In addition there will be weightted balancing to focus on minority target."
